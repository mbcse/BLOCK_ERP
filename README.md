# **NOTE THIS IS A DEPLOYMENT REPOSITORY OF SIH PROJECT, TO SEE MORE DETAILS ABOUT PROJECT PLEASE VISIT LINK :https://github.com/mbcse/SIH2020KMP_Hexa-Techies**

## Problem Statement
A web Based application using **Blockchain** technology is sought from **Airport Licensing** to retrive 
important and relevant **Project related information from of pool of data source i.e, SAP, E-mail, E-Office, Scan documents and DataBase**. Below features are desired in an application:
- Concerned Officers can **upload relevant data** related to Airport Licensing from Airports
- **Seamless Approval process**, **centralized Monitoring** and **suggestion Mechanism**
- **Relevant information should be fetched from data source**, linked to a particular project which can be used in the hour of need

## Our Approach and Solution
- We need to make scripts to fetch data from emails(Backend), scan documents(AI), sap(Backend) and other relevant sources
- we need to make a central database, most probably have to use cloud to store data(Backend and AI)
- We need to make Approval mechanism over blockchain(Blockcahin)
- we need to make centralised monitoring system(All the data need to be seen easily by all members or the officers concerned)(Backend, Blockchain and Frontend)
- We need to develop Feedback Mechanism to tell back the client that this is wrong you need to change it(Backend, Blockchain and AI)
- we need to make a system that will show and store important data easily(Frontend and Blockchain)
- The data provided by emails and other sources should be analysed and which data need to be stored and what not need to be determined(AI)
