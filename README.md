- we need to make a central database, most probably have to use cloud to store data(Backend and AI)
- We need to make Approval mechanism over blockchain(Blockcahin)
- we need to make centralised monitoring system(All the data need to be seen easily by all members or the officers concerned)(Backend, Blockchain and Frontend)
- we need to make a system that will show and store important data easily(Frontend and Blockchain)
- The data provided by emails and other sources should be analysed and whcih data need to be stored and what not need to be determined(AI)
